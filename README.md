# Sales Performance and Revenue Forecasting

## Problem Statement
Enhancing Business Strategy with Predictive Sales Forecasting.

**Background**: In a dynamic and competitive retail environment, the ability to accurately predict sales performance is essential for strategic planning, resource allocation, and financial management. Accurate sales forecasts enable proactive decision-making, helping to maximize revenue and optimize operational efficiency.

**Business Need**: Our retail business requires a robust sales forecasting model that can predict future sales volumes with high accuracy. This model must account for various factors that influence sales, including seasonal trends, promotional activities, and historical sales data.

**Objective**: To develop a machine learning model that forecasts monthly sales for the next quarter, enabling the business to:
- Prepare accurate financial projections for stakeholders.
- Optimize inventory levels to meet predicted demand without overstocking.
- Align marketing and sales strategies with anticipated customer buying patterns.

**Expected Outcome**: Implementation of a predictive model that provides:
- A forecast of monthly sales with a confidence interval, indicating the reliability of the forecasts.
- Insights into the primary factors driving sales trends.
- Recommendations for strategic actions based on the forecasted sales data.

**Success Criteria**: The project will be considered successful if it achieves the following:
- The model achieves a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of less than 10% on the validation dataset.
- The model's forecasts inform decisions that result in a measurable increase in operational efficiency and revenue.
- The business can utilize the model's insights to adjust strategies at least one month in advance of anticipated changes in sales trends.
